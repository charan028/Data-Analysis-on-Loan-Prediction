# **Data Analysis on Loan Prediction**

<sub>  Loan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces at
 least once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end
 of a retail bank. If Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real
time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.
 These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents,
 Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they
 have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for
 loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. we have to predict
 whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to
 predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s)
